This is abstract Music Player that I created during my Spring Core practical training. 
That's the list what I learned during this practice:
* What is IoC
* What is DI
* DI in constructors, setters
* Injecting values and referencies (also from an external file)
* Bean scope
* Bean lifecycle, init-method, destroy-method, factory-method
* Annotations @Component, @Autowired
